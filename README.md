# vim-config
My custom Vim configuration file

## Important
This config file is configured for a Vundle plugin maanger installed from the Arch User Repositories.

### What does this mean?
If you use a Linux distro that use the Arch and AUR repositories then installing the package vundle-git and replacing your .vimrc
file will work right off the bat. If not, make sure to edit this line in the .vimrc file to point towards your Vundle installation
(usually vundle.vim)
`set rtp+=` etc.
